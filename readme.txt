= 1.3.2 on July 31, 2022 =

* Fixed: Issues with plugin auto-updates that was introduced in version 1.2

= 1.3.1 on March 24, 2022 =

__Developer Updates:__

* Fixed: Using the deprecated `gravityview_blacklist_field_types` filter results in an incorrect list of fields that are available for filtering as well as a PHP error notice. (Note: please use the `gravityview_blocklist_field_types` filter instead!)

= 1.3 on March 15, 2022 =

* Added: Support for filtering by the Polish alphabet üáµüá±
* Added: Support for filtering by the Ukrainian alphabet üá∫üá¶
* Added: When filtering by a letter, the webpage will scroll back to the clicked link
* Modified: Localized numbers will be used for links instead of always 0-9. For example, in Bengali, the URL will now show `?letter=‡ß¶-‡ßØ`
* Improved: Multiple A-Z Entry Filter widgets may be added to the same View using different languages
* Fixed: Support for custom collation overrides in situations where accented letters are shown in a filter for the other (for example, L and ≈Å in Polish).
* Updated translations

__Developer Updates:__

* Removed legacy query overrides in favor of exclusively relying on `GF_Query`. This may, in theory, affect some custom code. If it does, it will stop filtering values. If that happens, please let support@gravitykit.com know.
* Added: `gravityview/az_filter/collation` filter to override collation for the letter comparison query. This is helpful when the database interprets multiple letters as the same due to collation. For example, in Polish, L and ≈Å. This functionality requires Gravity Forms 2.4.3 or newer.
* Added: `gravityview/az_filter/anchor` filter to modify the anchor ID added to the end of the letter filter links. Return an empty string to remove the functionality.
* Deprecated: `gravityview_blacklist_field_types` filter. Use `gravityview_blocklist_field_types` instead.
